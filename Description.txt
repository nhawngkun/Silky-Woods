🕷️ HOW TO PLAY: APPLE GARDEN BATTLE
Welcome to the apple garden! You are a brave Spider. Your mission is to spin webs to protect yourself and destroy the insects that are invading the garden.

1. Main objective
Survival: Don't let the insects touch you. You have 5 Hearts.

Hunting: Use Apple Trees as a fulcrum to spin webs, creating "Spider Web Zones" to capture enemies.

2. Controls
Move: Use the Joystick to control the Spider to crawl around the garden.

Releasing webs: Spider webs will automatically be released from the spider's abdomen when you connect with the Apple Trees.

3. Secret to spinning webs (Attack mechanism)
Your weapon is sticky webs. Follow these steps:

Grab: Crawl close to an Apple Tree to tie the first thread.

Spun: Run quickly to other Apple Trees to tie the thread between them.

Loop: Run in a closed loop (e.g. connect 3 trees into a triangle or 4 trees into a square).

Catch prey: When the loop is closed, a Web Zone will be created inside.

🕸️ Any Flies or Bees flying in that area will be trapped and killed immediately.

⏳ Note: After the web is finished, the Apple Tree needs time to "recover sap" before you can use it to spin more web.

4. Insects (Enemy)
Be wary of each type of insect:

Flies (Normal Enemy): They buzz and rush straight towards you. Although weak, there are many of them, gather them in one place and spin web to catch them all.

Bees (Enemy Pro): Much more dangerous!

They have venom and the ability to Dash very quickly to sting you.

When you see the Bee stop and glow (Gathering Power), be careful! It is about to rush, avoid its flight path immediately.

5. Support items (Buffs)
While hunting, you can pick up items to help the Spider become stronger:

🏃 Flexible Spider Legs (Speed ​​Up): Helps you crawl faster to set traps faster.

🌳 Speedy Sap (Reduce Cooldown): Helps the Apple Tree recover faster so you can continuously spin webs.

❄️ Sticky Web (Slows Enemies): Makes Flies and Bees fly slower, making them easier to catch.

❤️ Recover (Heal): Eat a delicious meal to restore lost health.

💡 Spider Tips
Surrounding: Don't just run straight. Run around the Flies to lure them into the middle of 3-4 Apple Trees, then close the circle.

Watch the Apple Trees: Only the ones that are healthy (Bright) can be tied with webs. Don't run into the corner with the ones that are withered (on cooldown).

Dealing with Bees: When the Bee is gaining momentum to charge, it's stationary. If you're quick, you can tie webs to trap it before it can attack!
